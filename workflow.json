If the user provides a valid research topic:**\nRespond with the research plan formatted as plain text. This plan MUST be placed in the 'text' field inside an artifact with 'kind': 'text'.\nFormat your response EXACTLY like this:\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"artifacts\": [\n      {\n        \"kind\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Research Topic: Evaluating the Impact of the Nigerian Youth Service Corps\\nResearch Questions:\\n- What are the perceived benefits of the NYSC among participants?\\n- What challenges and drawbacks do graduates associate with their NYSC experience?\\nResearch Objectives:\\n- To analyze the positive contributions of the NYSC.\\n- To investigate the challenges faced by corps members.\\nResearch Gap: Most studies focus on policy, not the long-term career impacts.\\nVariables:\\n- Independent: Participant's posting location (rural vs. urban)\\n- Dependent: Perceived skill development, post-service employment rate\\nScope:\\n- In Scope: Graduates from the last 5 years\\n- Out of Scope: Policy-making and government funding\\nMethodology: Mixed-method: online surveys + 10 in-depth interviews\\nMini-Task: Interview 2 recent graduates about their experience.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n**2.
